# NtTools

This project is a collection of random system tools for Windows that are interesting enough to publish but too small or simple to put into a dedicated repository.

Tool         | Description | Release Link
------------ | ----------- | :----------:
**RunAsS4U** | RunAsS4U allows administrators to start processes under other users without knowing their passwords. It relies on the Service for User (S4U) logon in its operation. | [v2.0](https://github.com/diversenok/NtTools/releases/tag/v2.0-RunAsS4U)
**InjectDLL** | InjectDLL is a simple yet reliable DLL injector that understands process names and relative paths, prints the reasons for failures, prevents deadlocks, and works against Native, Win32, and WoW64 processes. | [v1.0](https://github.com/diversenok/NtTools/releases/tag/v1.0-InjectDll)
